                    NSS unit (No. 182) started its functions within the campus from September 24,
                    2007 and is responsible for sensitizing the student members on social
                    responsibilities, legal rights and ragging menace. The unit organizes activities
                    to spread environmental consciousness among staff and students.
                    Later one more unit (No. 584) had been envisaged on October 27,
                    2015 to bring in more students under NSS. The aim of the units is to
                    inculcate among students a feeling of sacrifice, a spirit of service
                    and a sense of togetherness.
